# coastal-seasonal-prediction
Statistical coastal seasonal prediction of bottom temperature over the Northeast U.S. continental shelf

Target/Predictand - bottom temperature of subregions on the NEUS shelf

    These subregions are determined via a k-means clustering method
    Users could choose their own target regions for statistical prediction

Predictors considered in this analysis:

    1. Local persistence (or historical bottom temperature in this case)
    2. Upstream or nearby impact, presumably through advection
    3. Large-scale atmospheric or oceanic processes, 
       indicated by corresponding indices (e.g., the Gulf Stream Indices, NAO Index, etc.)
       
Prediction Models, according to those predictors mentioned aboveï¼š

    1. Local Persistence Model
    2. Persistence-Advection Model
    3. Gulf Stream Index Model and NAO Index Model
    4. Persistence-Advection with an Index Model
